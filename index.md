@def title = "Star Coffee"

Hello! I am Michal Jagodzinski, I am a new graduate from the aerospace engineering program at Toronto Metropolitan University and a Python developer at [Formify](https://www.formify.ca/). I'm interested in programming, spacecraft, simulation, and GN&C.

Welcome to Star Coffee, this site serves as my place to document work on projects and writings about random, rough ideas. Check out my [Substack](https://michaszj.substack.com/) for more refined articles, or [my homepage](https://michaszj.github.io/) for more of my work.
