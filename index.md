Hello! I am Michal Jagodzinski, and welcome to Star Coffee. This site serves as my place to document work on projects and to write about topics I am interested in. Check out [my homepage](https://michaszj.github.io/) for more of my work or my socials.

I am currently working as a Flight Dynamics Analyst with Calian Advanced Technologies at the Canadian Space Agency. Previously I was a Python developer at [Formify](https://www.formify.ca/). I studied Aerospace Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University. I'm interested in programming, spacecraft, simulation, and GN&C.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astra_kawa) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-jagodzinski-6860201aa/), I'm always happy to chat about my work!
