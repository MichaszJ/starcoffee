Hello! I am Michal Jagodzinski, I am currently working as a Flight Dynamics Analyst in the Satellite Operations team at Calian Advanced Technologies, previously I was a Python developer at [Formify](https://www.formify.ca/). I'm interested in programming, spacecraft, simulation, and GN&C.

Welcome to Star Coffee, this site serves as my place to document work on projects and to write about topics I am interested in. Check out [my homepage](https://michaszj.github.io/) for more of my work or my socials.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astra_kawa) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-jagodzinski-6860201aa/), I'm always happy to chat about my work!
