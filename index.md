Hello! I am Michal Jagodzinski, I am a new graduate from the aerospace engineering program at Toronto Metropolitan University and a Python developer at [Formify](https://www.formify.ca/). I'm interested in programming, spacecraft, simulation, and GN&C.

Welcome to Star Coffee, this site serves as my place to document work on projects and writings about random, rough ideas. Check out my [Substack](https://michaszj.substack.com/) for more refined articles, or [my homepage](https://michaszj.github.io/) for more of my work.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astra_kawa) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-jagodzinski-6860201aa/), I'm always happy to chat about my work!

I'm currently looking for work in the aerospace and software industries in Ontario, as well as looking into doing an M.Eng. or M.ASc. in the spacecraft GN&C field. If you are looking an aerospace engineer for work or research, please see my [resume](https://michaszj.github.io/documents/web-resume.html) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-jagodzinski-6860201aa/).
