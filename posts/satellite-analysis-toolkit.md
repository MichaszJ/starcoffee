## Overview

SAT is a collection of various tools and scripts for analyzing the functioning and behaviour of artificial satellites.

It is written in Julia and primarily utilizes the following libraries:

- [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/)
- [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl)
- [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl)

Disclaimer: This is a personal project for personal use and education, I cannot guarantee the veracity of the analyses/results that you would receive if you decide to use this tool, use with caution.
