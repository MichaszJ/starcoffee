It&#39;s based on an older project of mine called <a href="https://github.com/MichaszJ/orbit-tool">Orbit Tool</a>. Orbit Tool is a pretty simple <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> app that simulates orbits and plots ground tracks of satellites around Earth. I&#39;ve been wanting to expand on Orbit Tool but found Streamlit a bit limiting for my needs. I attempted to rewrite the project <a href="https://github.com/MichaszJ/orbit-tool-v2">using Julia and Genie.jl</a>, but I found using Genie a little convoluted and did not make too much progress.</p> <p>To scratch my itch of making software to analyze the functioning and behaviour of satellites, I started work on SAT. This time, I am focusing mostly on the analysis code itself, not web development. I still wanted some level of functionality, so I decided to use the plotting library <a href="https://docs.makie.org/">Makie.jl</a>, which provides interactive functionality. I will also eventually be creating some simple <a href="https://plutojl.org/">Pluto.jl</a> notebooks with interactivity.</p> <p>The majority of the code, at least in the short-term, will be mainly based off of my <a href="https://github.com/MichaszJ/scripts">scripts repository</a>, where I compiled a bunch of useful code from my undergrad and other projects. The scope of this project is for personal use and education, so I am not planning on actually developing it into a professional product or anything.</p> <h2 id=the_progress_so_far ><a href="#the_progress_so_far" class=header-anchor >The Progress So Far</a></h2> <p>So far I have built an interactive <code>Makie.jl</code> visualization called <a href="https://github.com/MichaszJ/satellite-analysis-toolkit/blob/main/src/GroundTracker.jl">OrbitTool.jl</a> for visualizing a satellite&#39;s orbit around the Earth and its ground tracks. The orbit is plotted in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-centered_inertial">ECI reference frame</a>, and the ground track plot has a setting to change the projection being used.</p> <img src="/starcoffee/assets/posts/getting-started-on-sat/code/orbit-plot.png" alt=""> <p>The algorithm that calculates the ground track points comes from <em>Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students</em> by Howard Curtis. If you are interested in learning orbital mechanics I recommend this textbook. I used this textbook during my orbital dynamics course and found it very approachable. It includes a lot of algorithms that you can easily implement in your programming language of choice, as I did in this project using Julia.</p> <div class=im-100 ><img src="/starcoffee/assets/posts/getting-started-on-sat/code/ground-track-plot.png" alt=""></div> <p>I&#39;ve also implemented sliders to adjust the orbital elements of the plotted satellite, it&#39;s honestly really fun just playing around with the sliders and seeing how the orbit of the satellite changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/astra_kawa/status/1642068166757982209">Check out my tweet to see this in action.</a></p> <p>The code is still pretty messy, especially when dealing with Observables and interactivity. I&#39;m not sure why, but working with them is just a hassle sometimes. But it works, now I just need to do some cleaning up and optimization.</p> <h2 id=whats_next ><a href="#whats_next" class=header-anchor >What&#39;s Next?</a></h2> <p>In the next short while I will be focusing on polishing up the <code>OrbitTool.jl</code> component, I am not fully satisfied with the layout of the interactive components and will be wrestling with Makie to get it looking decent. I am also planning on adding some additional features:</p> <ul> <li><p>Add orthographic projection mode with adjustable longitude and latitude limits &#40;see <a href="https://github.com/MakieOrg/GeoMakie.jl">MakieOrg/GeoMakie.jl</a>&#41;</p> <li><p>Add functionality for plotting multiple satellites</p> <li><p>Add functionality for adding ground stations and visibility analysis</p> </ul> <p>My next big interactive script I am planning to do is a simulator for various orbit types, such as two-body, three-body, restricted three-body, etc. This component will pretty much be the actual recreation of the old Orbit Tool.</p> <p>I am still trying to think of other big components to add, I want to try and implement stuff that could <em>actually</em> be useful for potential engineering work, but the scope of SAT still remains as a personal project for self-use and education.</p> <p>I am excited to keep working on SAT and seeing how this toolkit evolves. I am really enjoying using Julia and Makie so far making the <code>OrbitTool.jl</code> component. Feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/astra_kawa">Twitter</a> if you have any interesting ideas you want me to take on and implement.</p> <p>Thanks for reading&#33; I hope to have more written on here soon. I have a lot of half-baked experiments that I want to write about but feel that they are not complete enough for a post on my Substack, so expect to see a lot of updates here and there. I also hope to have more posts focusing on code and math moreso than explaining my past work, so expect to see that soon too hopefully. Until next time&#33;</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> <a href="https://michaszj.github.io/">Michal Jagodzinski</a>.
